## Inspiration

A babel plugin to allow you to write code in Irish that will be transpiled into JavaScript. The inspiration for this plugin came from [another babel plugin](https://github.com/christina-de-martinez/babel-plugin-glowup-vibes) which in turn was inspired by [the following video](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cwn5KYtIWDm/). I found this attempt at showing what Gen-Z would code like in a few years to be very funny, but it also made me think...

I've always loved learning Irish in school and I've missed speaking it since I left so this gave me the idea to write a plugin that would allow people to code in Irish which would then be transpiled into regular JavaScript. This was meant to serve as a deep dive for me into babel.js and as a refresher into Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) and other topics which I hadn't looked at since leaving college.

Overall this is meant as a bit of fun, but if you would like to contribute, you would be more than welcome!
